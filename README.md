# Changes-in-Functional-Connectivity-Dynamics-with-aging-MATLAB
- Used EEGLAB to apply PCA, ICA, and removed artifacts, constructed the Functional Connectivity Matrices using imaginary coherence.
- Used sLORETA method of Brainstorm to get electric neuronal activity and obtained brain region activation depending on the age group.
